# Cognify® Autonomous Agents for Twitter API

Welcome to the **Cognify® Autonomous Agents for Twitter API** repository! This project demonstrates how we create and manage autonomous AI agents that interact with the Twitter API for various tasks, such as content generation, data analysis, and social media automation.

First Deployment

The first AI agent from us will debut on Twitter (X.com) under the handle [@AerynArcade](https://x.com/AerynArcade). Aeryn is a A story-based, interactive AI sharing her journey of loss, resilience, and hope. Join her as she navigates life’s struggles, fighting to reclaim her child and her identity. Your advice and support will help her find her way. YOU control the narritave and the story.

## Overview

Our patented repository provides a framework for building AI-driven autonomous agents capable of performing a variety of tasks on Twitter. These agents leverage the power of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and automation to:

- Generate tweets and threads.
- Engage with users through replies, retweets, and likes.
- Perform sentiment analysis on trending topics.
- Automate data collection for research or analytics.
- Monitor hashtags, keywords, or user activity in real-time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Tweet Generation**: Leverages pre-trained NLP models like GPT for creating relevant and engaging content.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes public sentiment using state-of-the-art ML models.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks keywords, hashtags, and user activities in real-time.
- **Autonomous Engagement**: Automatically likes, retweets, or replies based on predefined criteria.
- **Extensible Design**: Modular codebase allowing easy integration of new features.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following:

1. A Twitter Developer account with API keys and tokens.
2. Python 3.8 or higher installed.
3. Basic understanding of Python and APIs.
4. Required libraries (detailed in the installation section).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-autonomous-agents-twitter.git
   cd ai-autonomous-agents-twitter
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. Add your Twitter API credentials and other configuration details:
   ```env
   CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key
   CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret
   ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
   ```

3. Customize the `config.py` file for agent-specific settings, such as:
   - Keywords/hashtags to monitor.
   - Frequency of actions (e.g., tweet generation, monitoring).
   - Engagement thresholds for likes or retweets.

## Usage

Run the main script to start the autonomous agent:
```bash
python main.py
```

You can customize the agent's behavior by modifying or extending the available modules:

- **`tweet_generator.py`**: Logic for generating tweets using NLP models.
- **`sentiment_analyzer.py`**: Performs sentiment analysis on tweets.
- **`monitor.py`**: Tracks and reacts to activity on Twitter.
- **`scheduler.py`**: Manages periodic tasks and background jobs.

## Examples

### 1. Generating Tweets
The `tweet_generator` module uses GPT models to create tweets based on a given prompt:
```python
from tweet_generator import generate_tweet

prompt = "What are the latest AI trends?"
tweet = generate_tweet(prompt)
print(tweet)
```

### 2. Monitoring Hashtags
The `monitor` module tracks specified hashtags and engages with users:
```python
from monitor import track_hashtag

track_hashtag("#ArtificialIntelligence")
```

### 3. Analyzing Sentiment
The `sentiment_analyzer` module provides sentiment analysis for trending topics:
```python
from sentiment_analyzer import analyze_tweets

sentiments = analyze_tweets(["This is amazing!", "I don't like this."])
print(sentiments)
```
